# Userminusone's microtonal tools for REAPER #

These are various scripts and configuration files I made for REAPER to make it easier to work with microtonal tunings via the Novation Launchpad MINI instrument.

I also made a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uENPS8EJ0kU) explaining how to use these tools. I recommend watching that as I try to explain everything on this GitHub repository in that video.
