# Userminusone's microtonal tools for REAPER #

These are various scripts and configuration files I made for REAPER to make it easier to work with microtonal tunings via the Novation Launchpad MINI instrument.

I plan to make a video on how to use these tools shortly, which will appear here once it is published.
